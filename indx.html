                <h3>Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data</h3>
                <p>Project Description
                    Data cleaning is an essential skill for data engineers, encompassing reading, modifying, splitting, and storing data.
                    
                     in this project you will apply your data-cleaning skills to process information about marketing campaigns run by a bank.
                    
                    You will need to modify values, add new features, convert data types, and save data into multiple files.</p>

                <h3>A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones</h3>
                <p>

                    In this project, you will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). You will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.
